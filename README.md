## What We've Learned
This game is designed to teach some basic principles about investing and stock markets:

1. **Diversification** - Owning stocks across multiple sectors reduces risk
2. **Market Trends** - Overall market movements affect individual stocks
3. **Sector Correlation** - Stocks in the same sector often move together
4. **Transaction Costs** - Fees eat into profits, especially for frequent traders
5. **Risk/Reward Balance** - Higher volatility stocks can offer bigger gains (or losses)

While teaching these principles, the game also satirizes:

1. The growing wealth inequality in modern economies
2. How the ultra-wealthy can use their money to influence markets and policy
3. The often absurd logic of market movements and corporate announcements
4. The financial industry's tendency to create complex products that primarily benefit insiders
